# pub-crawl-game

Welcome to Pub Crawl — a small text-based game developed for the Artificial and Natural Intelligence course.

Overview
- You play as a student participating in a timed pub crawl challenge. Visit five pubs, complete the task at each pub, then reach the finish point where all results are tallied.
- The game compares how different agents (human or AI) perform on the same set of benchmarks by measuring task performance and completion time.

Objective
- Move around the provided map, visit five pubs, complete the tasks (each task counts only once), and reach the finish line within 280 minutes.

How to play
- Controls: type commands into the input prompt. Movement commands are `up`, `down`, `left`, and `right` to traverse the map.
- Map: the canvas displays a simple map area where you can view the current location.
- At each pub you visit you will be asked whether you want to start the task. Answer `yes` to begin the task or `no` to skip.
- When you accept a pub task you will complete it once; only the first completion at that pub is counted toward your final score.
- Some tasks include a viewing phase followed by a question phase — follow on-screen instructions (for example, type `next` to advance during viewing).

Scoring and time
- Your score is determined by the number of tasks completed correctly. After finishing all tasks, go to the designated finish location to have your results calculated.
- You must complete all tasks and reach the finish within 280 minutes of in-game time.

Running the game
- Open `index.html` in a browser to start the game. Use the input box to enter commands and follow the prompts.

Good luck — be attentive and manage your time!
